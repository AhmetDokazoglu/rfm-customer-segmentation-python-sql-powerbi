# RFM Customer Segmentation with Python, SQL & Power BI

This project was developed to help businesses **identify their most valuable customers**, **detect at-risk customer groups**, and **make segment-based, data-driven decisions** by analyzing customer behavior.

During the analysis process, RFM metrics were calculated using Python and SQL. The resulting customer segments were then **visualized and transformed into a business-oriented story** through Power BI dashboards, making the insights clear and actionable for decision-makers.

### ℹ️ What is RFM?

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a widely used method in marketing and customer analytics that segments customers based on their **most recent purchase date**, **purchase frequency**, and **total spending behavior**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- Identifying high-value customers  
- Detecting customer segments with a high risk of churn  
- Measuring customer behavior using quantitative metrics  
- Transforming analytical results into **actionable business decisions**  

By doing so, businesses can design **data-driven marketing, campaign, and customer management strategies**.

---

## 🧠 Project Approach

Within the scope of this project:

- Raw sales data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Python  
- RFM metrics were calculated at the customer level using SQL  
- Customers were segmented based on their RFM scores  
- Segmentation results were visualized using Power BI dashboards  

In this project, Power BI is not used as a calculation tool, but as a **decision support and storytelling layer** that effectively presents analytical outputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- SQL (T-SQL)
- Power BI
- Excel / CSV data sources

---

## 📑 Project Outputs

- SQL queries for RFM analysis and segmentation  
- Python scripts for data preprocessing and preparation
